# üöÄ Full Stack Software Engineering Capstone: Integrated IT Solutions

## Overview

This repository serves as a **capstone portfolio project** integrating the core concepts and practical applications from various modules across a comprehensive Software Engineering curriculum. Built predominantly on the **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack**, this project demonstrates proficiency in foundational programming, architectural design, advanced API development, mobile application creation, and data science integration.

The project is designed to be **modular**, showcasing how each module's learning outcomes contribute to a cohesive and professionally developed system.

| **ITS 1155: ORM Concepts** | **Database Abstraction with Mongoose** | Utilizing Mongoose as an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for MongoDB, demonstrating schema definition, data validation, and seamless interaction between Node.js and the database. |
| **ITS 1114: Advance API Development** | **Robust & Secure RESTful APIs** | Designing, implementing, and documenting advanced RESTful API endpoints for the library system, including authentication (JWT), error handling, and data validation. |
| **ITS 1118: Software Architectures and Design Patterns I** | **Foundational Architectural Patterns** | Applying fundamental architectural patterns (e.g., MVC on the backend, component-based on frontend) and essential design patterns (e.g., Factory, Singleton, Observer) in the system's design. |
| **ITS 2020: Rapid Application Development** | **Efficient Prototyping & Iteration** | Utilizing tools and frameworks (like Express.js, React, Expo) to rapidly develop and iterate on features, focusing on quick delivery and feedback loops. |
| **ITS 2027: Advanced Mobile Application Development** | **Cross-Platform Mobile Client** | Building a feature-rich mobile application for library users using React Native (via Expo), including native features, state management, and responsive design. |
| **ITS 2118: Software Architectures and Design Patterns** | **Advanced System Design & Evolution** | Implementing complex architectural patterns (e.g., Microservices-lite, event-driven) and advanced design patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability, and extensibility of the library system. |
| **ITS 2122: Python for Data Science & AI** | **Data-driven Insights & Automation** | Integrating Python scripts (e.g., for analytics, recommendation engine, or overdue prediction) that interact with the MongoDB data, demonstrating data manipulation and basic AI/ML concepts. |
| **ITS 2135: Computer Networking for Software Engineering** | **Network Configuration & Communication** | Understanding and configuring network aspects of a deployed application (e.g., ports, firewalls, server communication) and ensuring secure data flow. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js (v18+)
  * MongoDB (local instance or cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
  * Python (v3.8+) for Data Science components
  * Yarn or npm
  * Expo CLI (for testing the mobile client)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
    cd integrated-it-solutions
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create `.env` files in appropriate directories (e.g., `/server`, `/client`, `/data-science`) based on provided `.env.example` templates.

      * `MONGODB_URI`
      * `JWT_SECRET` (for authentication)
      * `API_URL` (for client-side API calls)
      * `PYTHON_SCRIPT_PATH` (if integrating external Python scripts)

3.  **Install Dependencies (Backend/Server):**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies (Frontend/Web):**

    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

5.  **Install Dependencies (Data Science - if applicable):**
    If your `ITS 2122` components are separate Python scripts, create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    cd ../data-science # or wherever your Python scripts reside
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Create a requirements.txt with pandas, numpy, scikit-learn etc.
    ```

6.  **Run the Application:**

      * **Start the Backend (API):**
        ```bash
        cd server
        npm start # or yarn start
        ```
      * **Start the Frontend (Web):**
        ```bash
        cd ../client
        npm start # or yarn start
        ```
      * **Start the Mobile App (Optional - requires Expo CLI):**
        ```bash
        # From the /client directory
        npx expo start
        ```
